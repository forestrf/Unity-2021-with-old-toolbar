# Unity-2021-with-old-toolbar
Bring back the old toolbar that was removed on Unity 2021 to help those who prefer that workflow. MIT license ONLY on my own code (which it's nearly none) so refer to https://github.com/marijnz/unity-toolbar-extender and the source code from the old Unity's toolbar, both of them with their own licenses.

I created this asset to avoid having to click twice to switch in between center/pivot and global/local, as clicking on those buttons is the workflow of both my artist and me.

To access Unity's internals easily, which was needed to make this asset easier to put together, there's an assembly definition inside `/Unity project/Assets/Unity Internals Access/`. If you are interested in easily accessing internals too it may be useful to you.
