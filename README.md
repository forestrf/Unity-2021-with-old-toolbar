# Unity-2021-with-old-toolbar
Bring back the old toolbar that was removed on Unity 2021 to help those who prefer that workflow. MIT license ONLY for the code I made

This project uses https://github.com/marijnz/unity-toolbar-extender and source code from the old Unity's toolbar. This 2 pieces of code are under their own licenses.

I created this asset to avoid having to click twice to switch in between center/pivot and global/local, as clicking on those buttons are both my artist and my workflow.

To access internals easily, which was needed to make this asset easier to put together, there's an assembly definition inside `/Unity project/Assets/Unity Internals Access/`. If you are interested in easily accessing internals too it may be useful to you.
